                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Union was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 17, 1853, from portions of Bethlehem Township. Clinton Town was formed on April 5, 1865, within portions of the township, and became an independent municipality in 1895. The township was named for Union Furnace, which was producing iron from 1742 until the 1780s. The name 'Union' was chosen over the alternative 'Rockhill', which was a community at the southern end of the township.</p>
